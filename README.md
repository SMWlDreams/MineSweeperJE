# MineSweeper Java Edition

## Authors: Joseph Hable

### Created in Java 11.0.2 using JavaFX 11.0.1

This is my personal adaptation of the famous DOS game MineSweeper. This game is made entirely in the Java language and is meant to be a close imitation of Minesweeper for Windows XP. This project is fully open source and anyone may use the source files as long as I am credited in the final submission.

Note: Due to size restrictions the version on GitHub does not contain JavaFX libraries and will require you to have them preinstalled. In order to download the full jar with all libraries please go to the following:

# Change log

## Version 1.0.1

Fixed a bug allowing users to infinitely enter their high score if they attempted to close out of the window first.

## Version 1.0.2

Fixed two bugs related to registering high scores. One prevented the current high scores from being shown if the user got a new high score that was not 1st place. The other fixed a bug that prevented users from changing which high scores were shown after they registered a new high score without restarting the application.
