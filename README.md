# MineSweeper Java Edition

## Authors: Joseph Hable

### Created in Java 11.0.2 using JavaFX 11.0.1

This is my personal adaptation of the famous DOS game MineSweeper. This game is made entirely in the Java language and is meant to be a close imitation of Minesweeper for Windows XP. This project is fully open source and anyone may use the source files as long as I am credited in the final submission.

Note: Due to size restrictions the version on GitHub does not contain JavaFX libraries and will require you to have them preinstalled. In order to download the full jar with all libraries please go to the following:

# Change log

## Version 1.0.1

Fixed a bug allowing users to infinitely enter their high score if they attempted to close out of the window first.

## Version 1.0.2

Fixed two bugs related to registering high scores. One prevented the current high scores from being shown if the user got a new high score that was not 1st place. The other fixed a bug that prevented users from changing which high scores were shown after they registered a new high score without restarting the application.

## Version 1.1.0

### New Features

#### Added Hotkey Functionality

Hotkeys have been added for the core functions of the game. They work simply by pressing the corresponsing button while in the application. The hotkeys default to the specified hotkeys if the Hotkeys.ini file is missing from the user directory. The default hotkeys are; P for pause, R for restart, H opens the help menu, A opens the about menu, N starts a new game and S opens the high score dialogue. Added these hotkeys to a new "hotkeys" menu which can be found under help. Changing hotkeys through the GUI will be added soon. Hotkeys can be manually edited by changing the corresponding letter in the Hotkeys.ini file found in the main filesystem. You can set the same character to mutiple hotkeys which may cause undesired side effects. I will remove this later.

### Bug Fixes/Improvements

#### New Board Size Logic

Updated the logic for determining the size of squares on the board so strangely shaped boards occur less frequently.

#### Updated Score Modifiers

Changed the score modifiers for the intermediate and expert difficulties. As it stood getting a new high score in expert was very difficult and was based heavily on the seed RNG for that run. The new values are as follows:

Intermediate - Lose 4 score every second

Expert - Lose 1 score every 2 seconds rounded down (I.E. if you win in 501 seconds, you will lose 250 points as 250.5 will be rounded down.)

#### Fixed Pause Bugs

Pausing and restarting the game no longer randomly crashes or leaves the application in an unusable state.

Fix to prevent the user from playing the game in the paused state by choosing certain options.

Fixed the game crashing when finshing a game in the paused state under certain circumstances.

#### Fixed Bugs With Log Files

Fixed a null pointer exception when generating a log file caused by beginning generation, starting a new game after and finishing. This would be thrown upon attempting to close the writer as the writer never properly existed.

Fixed empty logs being generated by creating new games after selecting generate logs in the same fashion as described above. Although this bug would never crash it could potentially corrupt the high score files and break the application.

Fix for not being able to enter in high scores with the generate logs option selected after starting a new game before finishing one.
