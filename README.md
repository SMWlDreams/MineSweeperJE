# MineSweeper Java Edition

## Authors: Joseph Hable

### Created in Java 11.0.2 using JavaFX 11.0.1

This is my personal adaptation of the famous DOS game MineSweeper. This game is made entirely in the Java language and is meant to be a close imitation of Minesweeper for Windows XP. This project is fully open source and anyone may use the source files as long as I am credited in the final submission.

# Change log

## Version 1.0.1

Fixed a bug allowing users to infinitely enter their high score if they attempted to close out of the window first.

## Version 1.0.2

Fixed two bugs related to registering high scores. One prevented the current high scores from being shown if the user got a new high score that was not 1st place. The other fixed a bug that prevented users from changing which high scores were shown after they registered a new high score without restarting the application.

## Version 1.1.0

### New Features

#### Added Hotkey Functionality

Hotkeys have been added for the core functions of the game. They work simply by pressing the corresponsing button while in the application. The hotkeys default to the specified hotkeys if the Hotkeys.ini file is missing from the user directory. The default hotkeys are; P for pause, R for restart, H opens the help menu, A opens the about menu, N starts a new game and S opens the high score dialogue. Added these hotkeys to a new "hotkeys" menu which can be found under help. Changing hotkeys through the GUI will be added soon. Hotkeys can be manually edited by changing the corresponding letter in the Hotkeys.ini file found in the main filesystem. You can set the same character to mutiple hotkeys which may cause undesired side effects. I will remove this later.

### Bug Fixes/Improvements

#### New Board Size Logic

Updated the logic for determining the size of squares on the board so strangely shaped boards occur less frequently.

#### Updated Score Modifiers

Changed the score modifiers for the intermediate and expert difficulties. As it stood getting a new high score in expert was very difficult and was based heavily on the seed RNG for that run. The new values are as follows:

Intermediate - Lose 4 score every second

Expert - Lose 1 score every 2 seconds rounded down (I.E. if you win in 501 seconds, you will lose 250 points as 250.5 will be rounded down.)

#### Fixed Pause Bugs

Pausing and restarting the game no longer randomly crashes or leaves the application in an unusable state.

Fix to prevent the user from playing the game in the paused state by choosing certain options.

Fixed the game crashing when finshing a game in the paused state under certain circumstances.

#### Fixed Bugs With Log Files

Fixed a null pointer exception when generating a log file caused by beginning generation, starting a new game after and finishing. This would be thrown upon attempting to close the writer as the writer never properly existed.

Fixed empty logs being generated by creating new games after selecting generate logs in the same fashion as described above. Although this bug would never crash it could potentially corrupt the high score files and break the application.

Fix for not being able to enter in high scores with the generate logs option selected after starting a new game before finishing one.

## Version 1.1.1

### New Features

#### Hotkey modification added to GUI

You can now change your desired hotkeys directly within the GUI by selecting the appropriate option from the hotkeys menu. In addition, you can reset the hotkeys to the default at any time by hitting the reset button.

If the hotkey file is corrupt or missing a new one will be created in the user directory automatically. This makes it so you don’t need to see an error telling you the file is missing every time you attempt to open the application.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed hotkey bugs

Changing hotkeys directly through the .ini file will now update when you complete an action in the window.

Pausing the game and resuming will no longer cause the hotkey for the pause button to disappear from its spot in the menu.

Added the pause hotkey to the resume button in the menu as well to avoid any confusion regarding using that hotkey multiple times.

Empty or invalid hotkeys will no longer show up as “(null)” in the menu unless manually edited by the user through the .ini file. A logical check for updating the hotkeys will be added with the next major code revision as it requires a full refactor of how hotkeys are loaded into the application.

## Version 1.3.0

Yes I know I skipped 1.2.0 I was just too lazy to update it here.

### Jar change

The jar file containing JavaFX libraries will no longer be updated on minor updates (I.E. 1.3.1). The information for minor updates will still be found in this readme. The source files will be updated for each minor change made.

### New Features

#### Launch Settings

Launch Settings added! You can now specify what settings the application loads with from the new launch settings window.

These settings can be found under a new file called Settings.cfg

### Improvements

Launch settings and hotkeys are now both found within the Settings.cfg file. This file also is now output in standard XML format for you nerds out there. This means that you can now delete the Hotkeys.ini file as it is no longer used by any subset of the application.

Updated the way that hotkey data is stored in the application so it will now only update if a change is made and saved rather than every time they were referenced.

Improved load times for different windows through optimized window handling.

Moved all image files to be located inside of the jar instead of in a separate folder. This means no more custom images can be loaded unless you compile the code yourself.

Changed the way the timer works by having it update every thousandth of a second so pausing and un-pausing can no longer be used to freeze the timer.

The version number has been added to the title of the main GUI.

Improved load times for the board through changing the way images are loaded.

Many places that threw exceptions now properly handle them or removed them all together.

Invalid settings or invalid hotkeys will not clear your saved settings for the other option.

Improved responsiveness of hotkey menus by having hotkeys pre-loaded.

Duplicate, null or blank hotkeys will no longer be accepted. Manually editing the file to create these will result in your hotkeys being reset.

Added option to enable resizing of the board due to pixel counts being incorrect on certain screen resolutions (will be creating a hard fix later and removing this option at that point.) This new option can be found under the "Game" menu.

Changed some text fields to just be text so the ugly highlighting is no longer there.

Changed the choice box in the high scores menu to a combo box which allows it to show the currently selected difficulty there as well as in the header.

The source code was finally commented properly! This means that you can finally understand what is going on inside of the application just by reading the comments.

### Bug Fixes

Restarting the game after winning or losing and opening a menu no longer places the game in an unplayable state until it is paused once.

The restart hotkey is no longer bound to the pause hotkey and vice versa.

Application no longer crashes when the Logs or Records folders do not exist.

## Version 1.3.1

### Improvements

Added a default hotkey to reset the settings file (hitting Ctrl + R will bring up a confirmation window to reset the settings then start a new game).

You can now view high scores even while playing a game with a custom board. The selection model will default to easy.

### Bug Fixes

Using a preset hash will no longer crash the application on startup when specified in launch settings.

The settings verifier now properly sets the ERROR_LEVEL to 0 before verifying the file so it no longer things it is invalid after failing on startup.

Using a preset hash and seed will no longer cause the board to be generated twice causing the board to overflow downward and the game to become unplayable.

Loading a game using the set seed parameter will no longer disable the restart function.
